# Lishp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Michael-F-Bryan/lishp.svg?branch=master)][travis]

Yet another lisp interpreter. This time, written in `Rust`.


Documentation for the `interpreter` is automatically generated by travis-ci and
is available at https://michael-f-bryan.github.io/lishp.

## Build & Run

You'll probably need to use a nightly version of the Rust compiler to build
this. For more information, visit https://rustup.rs/.

Next, get the source code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/lishp
```

And build,

```
$ cargo build
```

You can then run the interpreter (located at `src/bin/interpreter.rs`) using
cargo.

```
$ cargo run --bin interpreter
```

Or you can always use the binary directly.

```
$ ./target/debug/interpreter
```
